# Movie-App-imdbApi

With this project, you can add any movie you want to your list.

After watching, you can click on the icon and remove it from the list.

It allows pagination through results and provides the option to create custom lists which can be created, added to, removed from and deleted. The lists are stored in the browsers local storage, they remain persistent until the cache has been cleared or local storage is full.

My goal in creating this project was to create a clean and minimal site that gets out of your way, while still being feature rich and useful.
